# Meetless

Meetless is a native macOS meeting recorder for local-first capture, transcription,
saved sessions, and optional Gemini-generated session notes.

The app records a meeting into two separate audio sources:

- `Meeting`: ScreenCaptureKit system audio.
- `Me`: ScreenCaptureKit microphone capture.

Both sources are normalized for local English or Korean transcription, optionally
translated to the configured output language, written into a local session
bundle, and shown as one committed display transcript timeline. Saved sessions
can be reopened from the Sessions screen, reviewed as read-only display
transcript snapshots, and enriched with a permanent Gemini summary plus simple
action-item bullets.

## Requirements

- macOS 15 or newer.
- Xcode with the macOS SDK.
- Git submodule support for the pinned `whisper.cpp` dependency.
- Screen Recording and Microphone permissions for runtime recording.
- A Gemini API key for optional session-note generation and Gemini transcript
  translation.
- An OpenAI API key when OpenAI is selected for transcript translation.
- A Google Translate API key when Google Translate is selected for transcript
  translation.

## Project Layout

- `Meetless.xcodeproj` - Xcode project with the `Meetless` app and
  `MeetlessTests` test target.
- `MeetlessApp/App` - SwiftUI app entrypoint, shell navigation, app-level state,
  and Gemini settings UI.
- `MeetlessApp/Features` - Record, Sessions, and Session Detail screens.
- `MeetlessApp/Services/Capture` - ScreenCaptureKit capture session for system
  audio and microphone input.
- `MeetlessApp/Services/AudioPipeline` - audio normalization and per-source WAV
  writing during active recording.
- `MeetlessApp/Services/SessionRepository` - local session bundle persistence,
  transcript snapshots, audio artifact resolution, AAC compression, and generated
  notes storage.
- `MeetlessApp/Services/GeminiAPIKeyStore` - Keychain-backed Gemini, OpenAI,
  and Google Translate API key storage.
- `MeetlessApp/Services/GeminiSessionNotes` - Gemini Files API upload,
  `gemini-2.5-flash` generation, structured response parsing, and orchestration.
- `MeetlessApp/Services/TranscriptTranslation` - Gemini/OpenAI/Google Translate
  transcript translation request clients and provider configuration.
- `MeetlessPackages/WhisperCppBridge` - Swift-facing bridge around the bundled
  `whisper.cpp` framework and model.
- `Vendor/whisper.cpp` - pinned upstream whisper dependency.
- `scripts` - bootstrap, framework build, and DMG packaging commands.
- `docs` - release and distribution documentation.
- `history` - Khuym feature context, phase contracts, reviews, and learnings.

## Setup

Initialize and build the pinned whisper framework:

```zsh
./scripts/bootstrap-whisper.sh
```

The bootstrap command initializes `Vendor/whisper.cpp` when needed, downloads the
local `ggml-base.bin` model when missing, and then runs the framework build. To
rebuild the framework after the submodule and model are present:

```zsh
./scripts/build-whisper-xcframework.sh
```

The Release app expects these bundled resources:

- `MeetlessApp/Resources/Models/ggml-base.bin`
- `MeetlessApp/Resources/Samples/jfk.wav`
- `Vendor/whisper.cpp/build-apple/whisper.xcframework`

## Build And Test

List available schemes:

```zsh
xcodebuild -list -project Meetless.xcodeproj
```

Build the app:

```zsh
xcodebuild \
  -project Meetless.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Meetless \
  -configuration Debug \
  build
```

Run the test suite:

```zsh
xcodebuild test \
  -project Meetless.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Meetless \
  -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

Focused test examples:

```zsh
xcodebuild test \
  -project Meetless.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Meetless \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -only-testing:MeetlessTests/SessionRepositoryTests

xcodebuild test \
  -project Meetless.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Meetless \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -only-testing:MeetlessTests/GeminiSessionNotesClientTests
```

## Runtime Behavior

Meetless is sandboxed and carries these entitlements:

- `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`
- `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`
- `com.apple.security.network.client`

Recording start evaluates Screen Recording and Microphone access. Screen
Recording changes require quitting and reopening the app before recording can
proceed. Microphone changes can be retried in the running app.

The app stores saved sessions under the user's Application Support directory:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Meetless/Sessions/<session-id>/
```

A saved session bundle contains:

- `session.json` - manifest, status, source health, audio artifact names,
  transcript snapshot state, and optional generated-notes pointer.
- `transcript.json` - committed display transcript chunks as saved by the local
  transcription pipeline. Hidden original transcript fields may be present when
  translation was enabled.
- `meeting.m4a` and `me.m4a` - compressed source audio after successful stop.
- `meeting.wav` and `me.wav` - durable fallback artifacts when AAC compression
  does not complete.
- `generated-notes.json` - hidden Gemini transcript, visible summary, and simple
  action-item bullets when notes have been generated.

Finished WAV artifacts are compressed to AAC `.m4a` at 48 kbps. The original WAV
file remains the durable source of record when compression fails.

## Local Transcription

Meetless bundles the multilingual Whisper `base` model for on-device
transcription. Settings lets the user choose English or Korean; the selected
language applies to the next recording and the smoke transcription action.

## Transcript Translation

Settings also lets the user choose a transcript output language: English,
Korean, or Vietnamese. When the output language differs from the Whisper source
language, Meetless translates each committed transcript window before it appears
live and before it is written to `transcript.json`.

Gemini is the default translation provider and reuses the saved Gemini API key.
OpenAI can be selected with its own Keychain-backed API key; the default OpenAI
translation model is `gpt-5.4-mini` through an OpenAI-compatible chat
completions endpoint. Google Translate can be selected with its own
Keychain-backed Cloud Translation Basic v2 API key. Provider model and base URL
presets can be overridden in Settings for LLM-backed providers.

If translation fails or a provider key is missing, recording continues and the
original transcript text is displayed and saved with warning metadata.

## Gemini Session Notes

The Settings screen stores a Gemini API key in macOS Keychain. Session Detail
uses the saved key to generate notes for a selected saved session.

The v1 notes flow has a fixed product contract:

- The user confirms every upload before saved audio leaves the Mac.
- Both saved source audio artifacts are uploaded separately.
- Gemini uses `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- The client uses the Gemini Files API resumable upload protocol:
  start upload, read `X-Goog-Upload-URL`, upload/finalize bytes, then call
  `generateContent`.
- The visible result contains `Summary` and `Action Items`.
- The Gemini transcript is persisted for audit/debug/future use and is hidden
  from the Session Detail UI.
- Notes are permanent for v1. Generate is disabled after notes exist.
- Failed generation keeps the saved session unchanged and shows a retryable
  error.

Supported upload artifact extensions are `.m4a`, `.wav`, and `.wave`.

## Debug And Review Helpers

Print the redacted storage-root label at app startup:

```zsh
xcodebuild \
  -project Meetless.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Meetless \
  -configuration Debug \
  -derivedDataPath .derived \
  build

MEETLESS_PRINT_STORAGE_ROOT=1 \
.derived/Build/Products/Debug/Meetless.app/Contents/MacOS/Meetless
```

The app prints `MEETLESS_RUNTIME_STORAGE_ROOT=redacted` plus a container label,
not the user's absolute Application Support path.

Force transcript snapshot write failure for review injection:

```zsh
MEETLESS_FORCE_TRANSCRIPT_SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_FAILURE=1 \
.derived/Build/Products/Debug/Meetless.app/Contents/MacOS/Meetless
```

This path is for local validation of incomplete/lagging snapshot honesty
markers. Generated-notes failure injection is exposed through test-only override
seams.

## Packaging

Create a DMG:

```zsh
./scripts/package-dmg.sh
```

The packaging script runs tests by default with signing disabled, builds the
Release app, verifies the bundled model and embedded whisper framework, checks
the app signature, creates a compressed DMG in `.dist/`, and verifies the DMG.
Without a Developer ID setting it uses an ad-hoc local signature.

Packaging environment options:

- `SKIP_TESTS=1` - skip the pre-package `xcodebuild test` step.
- `DMG_NAME=<name>.dmg` - choose the output name under `.dist/`.
- `DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION="Developer ID Application: Long Le (63M98WD275)"` -
  replace the default ad-hoc signature with Developer ID and hardened runtime.
- `NOTARY_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=Meetless-Notary` - submit, staple, and validate the
  DMG with Apple's notary service.

Internal Developer ID DMG:

```zsh
SKIP_TESTS=1 \
DMG_NAME="Meetless-internal-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).dmg" \
DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION="Developer ID Application: Long Le (63M98WD275)" \
./scripts/package-dmg.sh
```

Fully notarized DMG:

```zsh
DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION="Developer ID Application: Long Le (63M98WD275)" \
NOTARY_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE="Meetless-Notary" \
./scripts/package-dmg.sh
```

See `docs/release-dmg.md` for install notes, signing checks, and notary setup.
